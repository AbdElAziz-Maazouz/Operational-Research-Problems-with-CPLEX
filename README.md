# Operational Research Problems with CPLEX

## Overview

This project provides solutions to various operational research problems using IBM's CPLEX optimization solver. The project includes implementations for several classic problems in operational research, including task assignment, frequency allocation, bin packing, game strategies, and maximum stable set problems.

5. [**Maximum Stable Set Problem**](ProblemMaxStable.java)
    - Determines the largest stable set in a graph where no two vertices in the set are adjacent.
  
6. [**Knapsack Problem**](SacDos.java)
    - The Knapsack Problem is a combinatorial optimization problem where the objective is to select a subset of items to include in a knapsack without exceeding its capacity,        while maximizing the total value of the items.
      
7. [**Bin Packing Problem**](BinPacking.java)
    - Solves the problem of packing objects of different volumes into a finite number of bins in a way that minimizes the number of bins used.
      
8. [**Game Strategy Problem**](Jeux.java)
    - Finds the optimal strategy in a game scenario by maximizing the total score while adhering to the constraints.
